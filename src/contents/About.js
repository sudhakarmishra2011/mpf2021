            <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
            now Iâ€™m 22 years old, Pursuing my Computer Science & Engineering Degree in
            Sapthagiri College of Engineering, Bangalore.  Web development is my center of interest, I always
            love the idea of cross-platform development, and one code base deploy into almost
            any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
